WordPress Child Theme Starter-kit
===

Hi. I'm a WordPress Child Theme Starter-kit. I'm a child-theme so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress child-theme out there. That's what I'm here for.

My purpose is to allow you to leverage all the juicy awesomeness of your parent theme, while keeping it modular and maintainable allowing you to never have to touch the parent theme files.

Getting Started
---------------

To begin using this child-theme, you will want to download me from [Github](https://github.com/wobble-dev/wp-child-theme-starter).

1. Rename my `wp-child-theme-starter` folder to whatever you want to call your child-theme (be consistent.)
2. Change the `Author` section in the `style.css` file to your name.
3. Change the `Author URI` section in the `style.css` file to your desired web address.
4. Change the `Template` section in the `style.css` file to folder name of the parent theme your are making me for.
5. Next, update or delete this readme.

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Good luck!
